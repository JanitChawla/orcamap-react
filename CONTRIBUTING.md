## How to contribute to OrcaMap


#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Awesome! Suggest your change in the [Issues](https://github.com/orcasound/orcamap-react/issues)

### **Are you a Google Summer of Code Student?**

* Great! Please review https://github.com/orcasound/orcagsoc/issues and our repo's [Issues](https://github.com/orcasound/orcamap-react/issues)
* On Slack, prefer group communication. Please do not DM Ivan or project leads directly, post questions and ideas in [#orcamap-react](https://orcasound.slack.com/archives/C010J5ENUMN) so that the group is aware of movement on the project

### **Before coding:** 
  - Please make sure you review the [#orcamap-react](https://orcasound.slack.com/archives/C010J5ENUMN) channel history
  - Post what you would like to work on in the channel and Github issues and make sure others are not already working on it
  - Post in the [#orcamap-react](https://orcasound.slack.com/archives/C010J5ENUMN) channel when you have begun work
  - Your branch name and commit messages should follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standards - no generic names like 'dev'. Use `npm run commit` to use [commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) to help name commits
  - Your PR should show up in [#orcamap-react](https://orcasound.slack.com/archives/C010J5ENUMN) automatically from the Github bot


*It's all about clear and detailed communication in the group.* This is a self-organizing group, so communication is key.
### **Good PR's solve one thing**

* Instead of thinking of a PR as "here's all the work I did today" Please limit your PR to one topic or unit of code. This makes PRs smaller, easier to review, and easier to merge
* Tag other contributors for review on your PR
* Include tests if possible

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Orcamap**, and instead to refer to our [security policy](https://orcasound.org/security/).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/orcasound/orcamap-react/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/orcasound/orcamap-react/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
